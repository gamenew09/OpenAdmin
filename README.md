# OpenAdmin

OpenAdmin is a open-source administration tool for Roblox made by Gamenew09 and is made to be easy to use and extensible by developers.

## Installing
If you want to install OpenAdmin into your place, you can get the model [here](#no-link-yet-sorry). (Currently not released as a Roblox model yet)

I am planing on creating a OpenAdmin installer plugin, which will allow you to install OpenAdmin easily and easily edit settings without going into game .

## Editing the Source
**Only do this if you are wanting to contribute to the source code of OpenAdmin. If you are just wanting to add OpenAdmin to your place refer to the step in [Installing](#Installing).**

If you are wanting to contribute to this project you will need to get [rojo](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo#installation) and follow it's instructions to install.

If you are on Windows, I would recommend you to add the path that you have rojo installed to your ``PATH`` environment variable. Which would allow you to call it using ``rojo serve`` instead of ``"C:/path/to/rojo.exe" serve``.

If you don't know here how you can do it:
 1. Search ``environment`` into the search bar either in the start menu (if you are on Windows 7) or on the task bar (if you are on Windows 10).
 2. Then click on ``Edit the system environment variables``
 3. Click on ``Environment Variables`` on the dialog that appears
 4. On the new dialog, look for the ``System Variables`` list and look for ``Path``
 5. Double click on ``Path`` and either click on ``Add`` and paste/type in the location of ``rojo.exe`` or add a ``;`` at the end of the Value textbox in the new dialog and paste/type in the location of ``rojo.exe``

## Developer Documentation
Currently there is no documentation for developers who want to extend OpenAdmin. Once documenting starts, there will be a link here.
